- MacOS (Coming some day, hopefully...)

#### How to make it work/run
a) Download **every folder** and **Calcomizer.exe** if you don't have the application on your system. Make sure the .exe is in the same directory as the folders. (Like they are in the Google Drive)

b) If you have already downloaded a previous version of the application you can skip downloading the **JRE**, **Custom Sets** and **Icons** folders and just download the .exe to get the latest version.

c) You can skip downloading the **JRE** folder if you already have an up to date installation of Java on your computer.

### Features

- Create custom talents and talent trees, add notes for other changes

- Ideas can easily be shared by adding to or uploading folders from the **'Custom Sets'** directory

- Explore possible builds with the Talent Calculator

- Talents and Notes can be moved around on the same tree/container. (Drag and drop)
